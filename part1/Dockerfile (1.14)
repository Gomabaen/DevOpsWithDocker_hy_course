# Gemfile was edited:
#	original line  gem 'tzinfo-data', platforms: [:mingw, :mswin, :x64_mingw, :jruby] was changed so that it does not specify platforms but is always added
# 	new line: gem 'tzinfo-data'
# gem 'tzinfo' line was added so that time zone infos are properly installed
#
# Btw, I tought this course would be about learning Docker, not to tweak rails so this was frustrating exercise.
